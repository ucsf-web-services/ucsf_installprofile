# Contribute to the UCSF Starter Kit

So you want to help out with development?  **That's Fantastic**.  Here is how you can get started:

## Overview of the process

1. [Initial Setup](#initial-setup).
2. Create a branch for your work.
3. [Make your changes](#writing-code).
4. [Run tests](#running-tests) to ensure your changes haven't adversely affected other areas of the system.
5. Commit your changes with a good [Commit Message](#commit-message).
6. Push your feature branch to your fork on Github.
7. [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request-on-github) so we can review, discuss, and merge your changes.

### Initial Setup

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. Fork the repository in GitHub with the 'Fork' button.

### Writing code

In order to get your changes accepted you will need do:

 * Follow the [Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards)

### Running Tests

* [Run Behat tests.](tests/behat/README.md)

### Commit Message

Some good rules for commit messages are

 * the first line is commit summary, 50 characters or less,
 * followed by an empty line
 * followed by a longer explanation of the commit if necessary

The first line of a commit message becomes the **title** of a pull
request on GitHub, like the subject line of an email.  Including
the key info in the first line will help us respond faster to
your pull.

### Create a Pull Request on Github

Go to *your* GitHub repository at
https://github.com/my-github-username/ucsf_installprofile,
switch branch to your topic branch and click the 'Pull Request' button.
You can then add further comments to your pull request.
